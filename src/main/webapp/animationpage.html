		<p>A membership program should be seen as an accelerant for work
			you must do.2 That is, it should be born from the desire for creative
			autonomy and for an untethered opportunity to explore with great
			curiosity and rigor, topics that may or may not be explicitly
			“commercially” friendly. I harbor no illusions — it’s unlikely for a
			magazine or publisher to bankroll a thirty-day walk from Tokyo to
			Kyoto along an old highway, chatting up nearly-dead barbers and
			looking to place 200-year-old woodblock prints by Hiroshige in
			conversation with the road of today. Sure, you can cover a small bit
			of the walk with a magazine commission, but to take the bigger risk
			of months of research, action, and follow up, you need a more durable
			foundation. This is where membership programs soar — they are
			implicit and durable permission machines. Implicit in that the
			support itself is a signal, and durable in that those signals are
			“distributed.” Permission via members is an assemblage of diffuse
			permissions, indie permissions, not a kingmaker bestowing some
			canonical singular permission. Creatively, I find this arrangement
			freeing. In praxis it has led to bigger, more audacious and ambitious
			projects than I would have attempted on my own. There is, however, a
			bargain to be struck. Namely: You must work. Perhaps harder than
			you’ve worked at any other job. A promise is made. You are granted
			permission by your members and in return you must work with an energy
			such that no question remains that your promise of rigor and
			curiosity are present in your output. I don’t think of this bargain
			as being “beholden” to members. I think of this bargain as a
			formalization, and, boy does it help me get work done. I find that by
			“formalizing” a newsletter, for example, I write more and better
			newsletters. By “formalizing” a walk, I walk with a sharper eye, open
			to more finely-grained details, with a greater empathy for those I
			meet along the road, and with an ever-stronger impulse to transmute
			those encounters into something much larger than the moment itself.</p>
